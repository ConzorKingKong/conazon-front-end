# Conazon Front-end

The front-end for Conazon. This project uses Nginx to reverse proxy api requests across the other go microservices. Session is handled in the cookies set by the [`conazon-users-and-auth`](https://github.com/conzorkingkong/conazon-users-and-auth) project.

This project requires a `.env` file configured as follows:

```
REACT_APP_PROTOCOL=http
REACT_APP_DOMAIN=localhost
```

and a `.env.backend`
